<p>
I was born in Brisbane, then moved to Perth and I now have lived in Melbourne for 13 years…. I think. I am half Jordanian (fathers’ side). I did year 12 at Frankston High School.
I play a lot of basketball, too much. I enjoy listening to music, mainly Hip Hop and RnB. The shoe industry also interests me as well as some aspects of the fashion industry.</p>

<p>I don’t particularly have a specific interest within the IT industry. I’m doing this course to figure that out. I’m not sure when my interest in IT started but I know I’ve always been intrigued with technological advancements and finding little techy products to remove tiny inconveniences. My Dad sparked my interest from a young age as he always seemed to have the latest technology or was looking for what was next. I chose to come to RMIT after I figured out, I wanted to do a technology course. As the name states it is a pretty good choice for that kind of stuff. I also got an opinion from my uncle who works in the IT industry who consulted some Melbourne colleagues who said either RMIT or Melbourne Uni. After my time at RMIT I expect to have a good understanding of what is behind most technologies, how to create new tech, how to fix existing tech and how it’s all connected.

<h2>Ideal Job: Senior Work Specialist at Microsoft</h2>

<p>This role involves enabling clients to transform their workspaces regarding the Microsoft Modern Work and Surface suite, including, 365, Viva, teams etc. This role involves working within the modern specialist sales team as a senior Modern Work Specialist.

The skills needed for the role include industry knowledge regarding the FSI market, experience in technology related sales or account management, presentation skills and a passion for learning, developing relations with our modern work partners and formulating and executing an ambitious business strategy. To be considered for the role, 7+ years of tech-related sales or account management experience or bachelor’s degree in IT, computer science or business admin and 6+ years of tech-related sales or account management experience. I currently have none of these skills but that’s why I’m here. Completing this bachelor’s degree is a good starting point to obtaining this role. From there gaining experience at different tech companies and building relationships within the industry will greatly increase my chances of employment.

<h5>Assesment of Test Results</h5>

<p>These results highlight the fact that I am quite an introverted person who thinks quite deeply who often strives for perfection or almost perfection. I also knew that I learned by doing which the learning style test confirmed and the mental age test also confirmed that I am quite a mature 19-year-old who is enthusiastic, positive, and open to new experiences. I think these results show that I am willing to be a leader but also is happy to take the passenger seat. When forming a team, I think it is best for me to find a team with both enthusiastic and outgoing people who will lead and people who will contribute in a quieter low key way.

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h2>App – “Free Time”</h2>

<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p>The idea behind this project is to create an app that allows you and your mates to all connect to. Everyone then inputs their weekly schedules, then the app will combine everyone’s schedule to find the times when everyone is available. This can be used for anything from social sport gatherings to nights out and even just a trip to the movies it just makes that whole organisation period a little easier. Another function of the app will be the ability to input your chosen playlist from Spotify. So, whether you’re playing sport, travelling to a destination, or hitting the dance floor the music will be on point with everyone’s taste implemented into the rotation.</p>

Motivation:

<p>This app will be very useful as it takes the hassle out of the organisational period for social events and gatherings. From personal experience (being the one who usually instigates get-togethers) I know that getting everyone to pay attention when they need to say yes or no to something without posting some sort of meme or continuing a joke that was said weeks earlier can be hard. This will remove that annoyance by letting everyone fill out their schedules in their own time. Making an app is also the best option as it is easily accessible, especially with most people having quite busy lives no one has time to sit down and download giant files (especially with Aussie internet).</p>

Description:

<p>The idea behind this project is to create an app that allows you and your mates to all connect to. Everyone then inputs their weekly schedules, then the app will combine everyone’s schedule to find the times when everyone is available. This can be used for anything from social sport gatherings to nights out and even just a trip to the movies it just makes that whole organisation period a little easier. Another function of the app will be the ability to input your chosen playlist from Spotify. So, whether you’re playing sport, travelling to a destination, or hitting the dance floor the music will be on point with everyone’s taste implemented into the rotation.</p>

<p>The weekly schedule feature will allow each person to input anything and everything their doing throughout the week (so basically a calendar). This schedule will be private to each person (anything that people are comfortable sharing about their lives can be shared verbally like normal. This just allows the app to compare everyone’s schedules to provide times when everyone is free. The app will also include a ‘Free time length’ feature which will allow you to choose how long you want ‘Free time’ to be. This stops the app from giving the group a free time block of 30 mins (nothing is going to happen in 30 mins).</p>

<p>The Spotify connection feature will allow each person to link the Spotify within this app. This allows each person to pick 50 songs that will then be added to a communal playlist, these 50 songs can be changed at the start of each week to keep everyone happy as new music is released, and new tunes are discovered. Having this set number of songs gives everyone an equal chance to have their tracks played. This removes the chance of someone spamming songs into the playlist and ruining the variety of songs. This feature also removes the inconvenience of picking songs with multiple music tastes in a group. A ‘self-skip’ feature will also be included that only allows the owner of the song or the person who chose the song for the playlist to skip the song. I know from personal experience that when your favourite song gets skipped things can get heated very quickly.</p>

<p>You will also be able to create different groups within the app for example, you might have your basketball team group, your main social group or even a family group. This will allow you to tailor what music you want for each group. In the basketball group you would want more upbeat and enthusiastic music, for the social group whatever you want whether it’s chill or workout music and for family, focusing on the classics and keeping it clean.</p>

Tools and tech and Skills Required:

To execute the creation of this app various skills be useful mainly, competence with XCode which is ¬the UI you will need to create an iOS app. You can program using other languages such as Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript or Xamarin. To conduct this development, you will need a Mac computer that is updated to the latest version to optimise performance. Once you develop your app to must put it through Beta testing with a selected group of users to collect vital feedback. If you can’t get physical devices to test on, then you can test with devices that are accessible on the cloud. Within the app we will need to write a program that allows for the input of a schedule and then the comparison of multiple schedules to pinpoint a time in the week where nothing is scheduled across all group members. We then write a program to allow each user to create a 50-song playlist within Spotify to then combine with other group members into one large playlist. Then you can deploy your app onto the App store. This is all accompanied by excessive amounts of marketing if we want the app to take off.

<p>Overview:

If the outcome of this App is positive, then we will have a handy app that removes a large chunk of the organisation process for social gatherings and a remote DJ with everyone’s favourite songs. This will solve the problem of group chats being a pool of nothing whilst providing a platform for plans to get put into action. This also caters for the people (like me) who like having things planned and in concrete so problems and inconveniences can be minimised. The app will also give everyone a time to look forward to each week (if possible) within their busy schedules and it’s always good to have something to push you through tough times.
